  * Abstract expedition maps (lines, dots, contour marks).

  * Dotted path animating slowly (like a route being drawn).
  * Map pins that “pop in” when waypoints are set.
  * Rivers gently flowing to represent streams.

## ✨ Tone of Voice

* Fun, adventurous, optimistic.
* Emphasize exploration, discovery, and progress.
* Example taglines:

  * “Your Payments, Your Expedition.”

  * “Set Camp at Every Waypoint.”

## ⚡️ Example Usage

* A user creating a new stream sees a **dotted route being drawn** with each input step.
* The “Claim” button could look like **planting a flag** at a waypoint.
* Active streams could be displayed as **maps** with progress dots along a trail.
