# 🧭 Waypoint: Programmable Payments Across Aptos & Algorand

## 🌍 The Missing Layer in DeFi

Stablecoins have exploded across Aptos and Algorand. On Aptos alone, **USDC, USDT, MOD, USDY, and BUIDL** are already live, with **PYUSD0** and **USD1** coming soon. These assets power DeFi trading, lending, and liquidity — but when it comes to **payments**, crypto is still stuck in the past.

Most transfers are one-off. What if payments could be smarter?
That’s where **Waypoint** comes in.

## 🚀 What is Waypoint?

Waypoint transforms stablecoin transfers into **programmable payment routes**.

Instead of sending funds all at once, users can create routes that unlock value **over time**, **at milestones**, or even **conditionally**. Think salaries, grants, vesting, DAO distributions, or recurring savings — all made seamless, transparent, and composable.

## 🎯 Aptos First: Hackathon MVP

We’re launching the **beta on Aptos October 3rd** as part of the upcoming hackathon.

* **Supports Aptos stablecoins:** USDC, USDT, MOD, USDY
* **MVP feature:** Linear streaming (time-based transfers)
* **Example:** Pay 100 USDC over 30 days, with the receiver’s balance updating in real time

This is the **first step** toward programmable payments in the Aptos ecosystem.

## 🛤 Roadmap

### **Q4 2025**

* Waypoint expands to **Algorand** with xUSD as the settlement layer
* New route types:

  * ✅ Milestone payments
  * ✅ Cliff + vesting schedules
  * ✅ Variable-rate streams
* Integration with **Haven app** for recurring savings

---

### **Early 2026**

* Advanced routes: multi-recipient (payroll), escrowed (dispute-safe), and conditional (oracle or governance-linked)
* **Governance v3**: FLUX-gated access to premium features
* **COMPX bridged to Aptos**: rewards + governance live cross-chain

---

### **Mid 2026**

* **Native xUSD on Aptos** (via Orbital Lending)
* **Yield-enhanced routes**: streams that generate interest while in transit
* **Cross-chain routes**: send on Algorand, release on Aptos (and vice versa)
* Integrations with **Cairn (transparency)** and **Assembly (governance)**

---

## 🧩 Why It Matters

* **For DAOs**: Fund contributors in milestones, automate payroll, cut admin overhead
* **For Users**: Earn streaming salaries, vest tokens, or save automatically
* **For Builders**: Plug programmable payments into DeFi apps, lending markets, or governance flows
* **For CompX**: A cross-chain showcase of our ethos — **Innovation. Composability. Yield.**

---

## ✨ The Future of Payments

Crypto has solved **global value transfer**, but not yet **programmable disbursement**.
With Waypoint, every payment becomes a journey — whether it’s a salary, a DAO grant, or a governance-triggered bonus.

* Aptos gets Waypoint first (October 3rd beta).
* Algorand comes next (Q4 with xUSD).
* And by 2026, Waypoint will power **cross-chain programmable payments** across the CompX ecosystem.
